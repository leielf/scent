# scent
methods_... - code for a pair of files, where the first file contains staring coordinates of compounds and from the second compound we take coordinates of only significant compounds as their ending coordinates to predict the shift of the insignificant compounds.
m_..._error - calculates the average error (the difference in seconds between the predicted value and the one that was clicked by hand) of 3 systems of compounds (the files were taken like that: the fist file of the experiment and the last file of the experiment in the system)
